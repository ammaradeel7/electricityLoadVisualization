# electricityLoadVisualization
A visualization tool implemented with R and Shiny to extracted patterns and key insights from time series data.
The app is deployed on https://ammar-adeel.shinyapps.io/dataVisualization/

The visualizations in the first and second tab can be used to identify the trend in the time series for the different variables.
The graphs can also be used to allocate appropriate resources for the different cities during extreme weather conditions 
pointed out by the graphs such as heatstroke camps, planning of load shedding, and division of donated insulated clothing.

The graphs in the second tab are especially useful for comparing temperatures across different regions of Pakistan.

The values in the temperatures are of a high range, which is why the graphs in the third tab are useful for locating outliers in daily and
weekly aggregates, which can be useful in investigating power outages, and presentation of the statistics to stakeholders and executive committees
as the amount of data shown is aggregated, which makes the visualization clearer and easier to understand.
